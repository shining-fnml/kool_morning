This plasmoid shows if other computers on the network are up and running
or not. A sleeping computer on the same lan can be turned on by
wake-on-lan.

The plasmoid requires the icmp data engine to work, currently available
at https://github.com/shining-fnml/icmpengine (plasma5 branch).
The dataengine evaluates the status on basis of ping(8), which is
executed every 5 secs. Only the poll interval of the data engione is
configurable.
